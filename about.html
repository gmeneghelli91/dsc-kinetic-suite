            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Hello!</strong> I'm Giovanni Meneghelli, a dedicated R&D professional with over a decade of hands-on experience in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. My career has been a journey of growth, spanning from foundational work in medicinal chemistry to my current specialization in industrial process development and material science.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am an <strong>R&D Lab Technician at F.I.S. - Fabbrica Italiana Sintetici</strong>. Here, my work is centered in the <strong>Calorimetry and Particle Technology department</strong>, where I focus on the deep characterization of materials to ensure process safety, stability, and efficiency.</p>
            <p>This website is a passion project born directly from my daily work. I developed these tools to streamline the analysis of complex data and to share practical solutions with a community of fellow chemists, researchers, and students.</p>
